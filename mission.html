                    <h3>Gaganyaan TV-D1 Mission</h3>
                    <p>The Gaganyaan program is the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) ambitious mission to
                        demonstrate indigenous human spaceflight capability by sending a crew of three astronauts into a
                        low-Earth orbit (LEO) of 400 km for a three-day mission and safely returning them to Earth. This
                        historic endeavor, initially announced in 2018, aims to establish India as the fourth country,
                        after the United States, Russia, and China, to achieve independent human spaceflight. <br> To
                        ensure the safety and reliability of the crewed mission, ISRO is executing a series of uncrewed
                        test flights before the final human launch. A critical test vehicle (TV-D1) flight was
                        successfully conducted in October 2023 to validate the Crew Escape System, and further uncrewed
                        missions carrying the female humanoid robot Vyommitra are planned for 2025 and 2026. In August
                        2025, a significant milestone was reached with the successful Integrated Air Drop Test
                        (IADT-01), which validated the parachute-based deceleration system for the crew module's safe
                        splashdown. The first crewed mission is now targeted for the first quarter of 2027. <br> The
                        Gaganyaan spacecraft, known as the Orbital Module, consists of a Crew Module (CM) and a Service
                        Module (SM). The CM is the pressurized, habitable space for the astronauts, designed to
                        withstand the harsh conditions of re-entry. The SM provides essential support systems, including
                        propulsion, power, and thermal control. For launch, a human-rated version of the LVM3 rocket,
                        ISRO's most powerful launch vehicle, is being used. The four astronaut-designates, all Indian
                        Air Force test pilots, are undergoing rigorous training in India, building upon initial training
                        received in Russia. <br> The Gaganyaan mission holds immense significance for India, with
                        benefits spanning technological, scientific, and strategic domains. It will foster a robust
                        space ecosystem, inspiring a new generation of scientists and engineers while stimulating
                        economic growth and employment. The mission's success will also be a stepping stone toward more
                        ambitious future goals, including establishing an Indian space station by 2035 and a crewed
                        mission to the Moon by 2040. By demonstrating self-reliance in this complex technology, India
                        solidifies its position as a major player in global space exploration. </p>

                    <h3>ADITYA-L1 </h3>
                    <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Aditya-L1 is India's first dedicated space-based
                        mission to study the Sun, launched on September 2, 2023. After a 126-day journey, the spacecraft
                        was successfully inserted into a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1 (L1) on
                        January 6, 2024. The strategic placement at L1, approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth,
                        offers Aditya-L1 an uninterrupted, continuous view of the Sun without being obscured by eclipses
                        or occultations. This unique vantage point is crucial for studying solar activities and space
                        weather in real-time, providing an early warning system for events that could impact
                        technological infrastructure on Earth. <br> The mission is designed to address key mysteries in
                        solar physics, such as the mechanisms behind the extreme heating of the solar corona, the
                        drivers of solar wind acceleration, and the origins of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar
                        flares. Aditya-L1 carries seven specialized payloads, developed collaboratively by various
                        Indian scientific institutions and ISRO centers, to observe the Sun's atmosphere in multiple
                        wavelengths. Four of these payloads are designed for remote sensing of the Sun, while the
                        remaining three conduct in-situ studies of the particles and fields at the L1 point. <br> The
                        remote-sensing instruments include the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC), which studies
                        the solar corona and the dynamics of CMEs. The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT)
                        captures images of the photosphere and chromosphere in the near-ultraviolet range, providing
                        unprecedented insights into solar flares and activity in the lower solar atmosphere. The Solar
                        Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer (SoLEXS) and the High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer
                        (HEL1OS) are dedicated to monitoring X-ray flares to understand the coronal heating mechanism
                        and the energy dynamics of solar eruptive events. <br> Complementing the remote-sensing payloads
                        are three in-situ instruments. The Aditya Solar wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX) and the Plasma
                        Analyser Package for Aditya (PAPA) analyze the solar wind's composition, energy distribution,
                        and particle dynamics. Finally, the Magnetometer (MAG) measures the interplanetary magnetic
                        field, providing critical data for understanding space weather drivers. <br> Since reaching its
                        orbit, Aditya-L1 has been successfully collecting and transmitting scientific data, leading to
                        groundbreaking observations. For example, the SUIT payload captured the first-ever image of a
                        solar flare "kernel" in the near-ultraviolet band, confirming the linkage between flare energy
                        and coronal plasma temperature. The mission's findings are expected to significantly advance
                        global solar physics research and improve space weather forecasting capabilities, protecting
                        essential satellite and communication systems on Earth.</p>

                    <h3>Chandrayaan-3</h3>
                    <p>Chandrayaan-3 mission achieved a historic soft landing on the Moon's south pole on August 23,
                        2023, making India the first country to do so. The mission successfully demonstrated end-to-end
                        landing and roving capabilities on the lunar surface, a significant step in India's space
                        exploration program, especially after the partial failure of the Chandrayaan-2 lander in 2019.
                        The Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft consisted of three main components: an indigenous lander module
                        named Vikram, a 26 kg rover named Pragyan, and a propulsion module that ferried the lander and
                        rover to lunar orbit. <br>After its launch on July 14, 2023, aboard an LVM3 M4 rocket, the
                        spacecraft underwent a series of intricate Earth-bound maneuvers to build up speed before a
                        trans-lunar injection. It successfully entered lunar orbit on August 5, followed by several
                        orbit-reduction and de-boosting maneuvers. On August 17, the Vikram lander separated from the
                        propulsion module to begin its final descent. The soft landing was executed flawlessly, with the
                        lander employing advanced technologies, including a laser Doppler velocimeter and robust landing
                        legs, to navigate hazards and make a gentle touchdown at the chosen site. The landing site, near
                        69°S latitude, was named "Shiv Shakti Point" by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. <br>Following the
                        landing, the Pragyan rover was deployed from the Vikram lander via a ramp, leaving imprints of
                        the ISRO logo and the Indian emblem on the lunar soil as it moved. The lander and rover were
                        designed to operate for one lunar day (approximately 14 Earth days) before shutting down for the
                        lunar night's extreme temperatures. During their operational period, the scientific payloads on
                        board collected invaluable data through in-situ experiments. Key findings include:
                        <br>Confirmation of sulfur and other elements like aluminum, calcium, and iron on the lunar
                        south pole's surface using the Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS). <br> Measurement of
                        the thermal properties of the lunar topsoil by the Chandra's Surface Thermophysical Experiment
                        (ChaSTE), which revealed significant temperature variations between the surface and a few
                        centimeters below.<br> Recording of lunar seismic activity by the Instrument for Lunar Seismic
                        Activity (ILSA), detecting movements from the rover and a potential natural
                        moonquake.<br>Detection of low plasma density near the lunar surface by the Radio Anatomy of
                        Moon Bound Hypersensitive ionosphere and Atmosphere (RAMBHA) instrument.<br>The discovery that
                        the landing site sits within a 160 km wide, ancient, buried impact crater, providing insight
                        into the Moon's geological evolution. <br>While the lander and rover entered sleep mode after
                        their operational life, the mission's propulsion module continued its journey. It was
                        successfully moved from lunar orbit to a high Earth orbit in late 2023 to carry out additional
                        scientific observations of Earth, validating new maneuver strategies for future missions. The
                        successful execution of Chandrayaan-3 solidified India's position in global space exploration
                        and demonstrated its technological prowess in overcoming complex challenges. </p>

                    <h3>Mars Orbiter Mission</h3>
                    <p>The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also known as Mangalyaan, was India's first interplanetary
                        mission, launched on November 5, 2013. The mission was a landmark achievement, successfully
                        inserting the spacecraft into Martian orbit on its maiden attempt on September 24, 2014. This
                        made India the first Asian nation and the fourth space agency in the world to accomplish this
                        feat. The mission's success was particularly notable for its remarkably low cost of
                        approximately ₹450 crore.<br>The primary objectives of the mission were twofold: technological
                        and scientific. The technological goals included designing and operating a spacecraft for the
                        complex journey to Mars, performing trajectory maneuvers, ensuring autonomous functions, and
                        managing deep-space communication. The scientific goals focused on studying the Martian surface
                        features, morphology, mineralogy, and atmosphere using five onboard instruments.<br>Despite
                        being designed for a life of six months, the orbiter operated for over seven years, providing
                        valuable scientific data until communication was lost in April 2022. Key findings included
                        observing atmospheric escape during a global dust storm and studying the Martian exosphere,
                        which revealed that oxygen can exceed carbon dioxide at certain altitudes. The Mars Colour
                        Camera also captured thousands of high-resolution images of the planet's surface and its moons,
                        Phobos and Deimos, producing a Mars Atlas. The mission showcased India's indigenous
                        technological capabilities and elevated the country's prestige in space exploration. </p>
